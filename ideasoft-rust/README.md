## Post mortem
I appreciate the effort required to put out a free resource that has more of a course-like feel (quizzes at the end, bite-sized chunks, etc).
That being said, I still found this course to be rather sloppy especially as it got further along. It seems that the content and quality was prioritized at the beginning but not as the project went along. There were multiple code snippets that had glaring typos, some that didn't compile. Some chapters were 15-20 minute breezes while one took closer to 45 minutes to truly understand and work through. As an experienced developer, this wasn't a big deal for me. It might have even made the course more useful for me to have to debug their examples. The gods forbid an inexperienced person takes this course. I'm glad I did it, but I can't say I exactly recommend it. There are probably better options out there, but it did leave me with a reasonably quick way to get up to speed on a lot of basic concepts, syntax, etc.
